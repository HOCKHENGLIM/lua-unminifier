unminify/format those pesky lua files

Features
==============

unminify lua files and view them

drag and drop directory support

.zip support (required for regex searching, harddisk performance too strong)

search for text using regular expressions

commandline option (will overwrite input files, you've been warned)
  - luaformatter "mydirectory"

This is just something I through together really quick... I don't normally condone coding like this...
